zwavecontroller
===============

This project aims to provide a simple interface to interact with devices on a ZWave network.
All code is done in Node.js. 

None of the work is based on the official ZWave API. All ZWave API protocol information has been 
extracted from the 'open-zwave' (https://code.google.com/p/open-zwave/) project source code.
